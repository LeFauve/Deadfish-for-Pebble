# Deadfish for Pebble
This is a Deadfish interpreter for Pebble watches.

A compiled version is available [on the Pebble AppStore](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/563eaf4c5fafdbf3df000014).

Deadfish is a very odd interpreted programming language created by Jonathan Todd Skinner. It was released under public domain and was originally programmed in C.

It has only four commands:

- Press "Up" for the "**i**" command (increment accumulator)
- Press "Down" for the "**d**" command (decrement accumulator)
- Press "Select" for the "**s**" command (square accumulator)
- Press "Back" for the "**o**" command (output accumulator)

Additionaly you may also:
- Long press "Select" to delete your program 
- Long press "Back" to exit the application

Please refer to the [Deadfish website](http://esolangs.org/wiki/deadfish) for more details about programming in Deadfish.
